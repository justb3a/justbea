### Liability for content

The content of this site was created with the utmost care. However, we cannot guarantee that the content is accurate, complete or up-to-date. As service providers, pursuant to Section 7 Para. 1 of the German Telemedia Act (TMG) we are responsible under German law for our own content on this website. According to Sections 8 to 10 of the TMG, however, as service providers we are not required to monitor information transferred or stored by third parties or to investigate circumstances that suggest illegal activity. Obligations concerning the removal or barring of the use of information in accordance with legal regulations are unaffected by this. Any liability in this respect may however only be incurred from the moment that we become aware of a specific breach of the law. Should we become aware of any corresponding violation of the law we shall remove the content concerned immediately.

### Liability for links

Our site contains links to third-party websites, over whose content we have no influence. We cannot, therefore, assume any responsibility for this external content. In each case, the respective provider or site operator is responsible for the content of the linked sites. All linked sites are checked for potential violations of the law at the time of placing the link. No unlawful contents were apparent at the time each link was created. However, we cannot be reasonably expected to permanently check the content of the linked sites without any specific indication of a violation of the law. Should we become aware of any legal violation, we shall remove the offending links immediately.

### Copyright

The content and work presented on this website by the site operator are subject to German copyright law. Duplication, processing, distribution or any kind of utilisation beyond that permitted under copyright law requires the written consent of the author or creator. Downloads and copies of this site are permitted for private, non-commercial use only. Insofar as the content of this site was not created by the operator, any copyright of third parties is respected. In particular, content from third parties is indicated as such. Nevertheless, should you have reason to believe a copyright violation has occurred, we kindly request that you inform us of this. Should we become aware of any legal violation, we shall remove the offending content immediately.

### Data protection

As a rule it is possible to use our website without providing any personal information. Whenever personal data is collected on our website (for example: name, residential address or email addresses), as far as possible this always occurs on a voluntary basis. We shall not forward such data to third parties without your explicit consent.

We would like to point out that online data transmission (such as when communicating via email) may be subject to security breaches. It is not possible to ensure full protection of data against access by third parties.

We hereby expressly object to the third-party use of contact data, which has been published in accordance with the requirement in Germany to provide such information in an “Impressum”, for the transmission of not expressly solicited advertising and information material. The site operators expressly reserve the right to take legal steps in the case of the unsolicited sending of advertising material, such as via spam emails.
